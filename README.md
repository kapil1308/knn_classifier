# Breast cancer prediction with Machine Learning

Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN Classifier Algorithm.

# Objective

The objective of these predictions is to assign patients to either a benign group that is noncancerous or a malignant group that is cancerous.

# Dataset

The experimental study is based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer database from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The Breast Cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. It contains 699 instances, 458 (65.5%) benign and 241 (34.5%) malignant cases. Each case is characterized by 9 attributes as described by Table I and two classes (benign and malignant).

Attributes and domains are as follows: 

Clump Thickness: 1 – 10 
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 – 10 
Uniformity of Cell shape: 1 – 10
Marginal Adhesion: 1 – 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 – 10
Bare Nuclei: 1 – 10
Bland Chromatin: 1 – 10
Normal Nucleoli: 1 – 10
Mitoses: 1 – 10

# Install

### Supported Python version

  - Python version used in this project: 3.5+
	
  ### Libraries Used
   
   - [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
   - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   - [Numpy](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
   - [Scipy](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

	
# Run

To run this project you will require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) installed in your system.
Since the installation of Scikit-Learn is a little trivial it is better to install [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) instead since it comes with scikit-learn, numpy and scipy preinstalled with it.

# Preferred Editor

   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) but any other editor can also be used if you like for instance [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
